    <p><b> A Night to Remember at Linfromnowhere</b></p>

    <p>     Welcome to my first blog post! I want to share the whirlwind experience of a recent evening at Linfromnowhere, a cozy restaurant owned by my friend Lin. What started as a hectic rush of prepping dishes alongside Lin, her boyfriend Dara, and our friend Sokcheat quickly turned chaotic when Lin suddenly insisted I run home to freshen up before guests arrived. The moment I hit the streets, I was trapped in an endless sea of honking buses, crawling cars, and weaving motorbikes—every second ticking louder as I willed the traffic to move faster. When I finally made it home, I took what must have been the world's fastest shower before throwing on my uniform and racing back. By the time I returned, the restaurant had transformed into a warm, inviting space, and my new mission became arranging seats and polishing glasses until they sparkled. It was one of those nights where everything felt impossibly rushed yet somehow came together perfectly—the kind of beautiful chaos that reminds you why these moments are worth remembering.</p>

    <p> Just as I was working behind the bar, I looked up and saw a familiar face—Silorng! My heart leapt with surprise and joy. He wasn’t alone; a lively group of about 13 tourists followed behind him. And then, the moment I’d been waiting for: Tony, the guest of honor, walked in. I immediately stepped forward to welcome them all with the biggest smile, thrilled to see everyone.</p>

    <p> To my surprise, Silorng insisted I join them for dinner instead of working. “Sit with us,” he said, even offering to help with service himself! I happily introduced myself to the group, which had split across two tables. As I mingled, one woman stood out—warm, engaging, and full of respect from the moment she walked in. We ended up talking so long that I nearly forgot about dinner! She turned out to be an executive director at a university in Australia, and our conversation flowed effortlessly.</p>

    <p> When the food arrived, it was a feast of authentic Khmer flavors—fragrant amok, savory fried rice, and succulent pork shoulder glazed with sweet sauce. Every bite was a celebration of our local cuisine. </p>

    <p> As the night wound down, we gathered for photos—Tony, Dara, Lin, Silorng, and me, all smiling together while Untac happily played photographer, capturing the joy of our reunion. That evening was more than just a dinner; it was a marvelous, memory-filled celebration of friendship, good food, and unexpected connections. </p>
